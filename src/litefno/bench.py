"""Deployability measurement: size, FLOPs, latency, memory.

Why this module exists rather than a few ``time.perf_counter`` calls
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"Low-rank" is a claim about parameters. Deployability is a claim about wall
clock, resident memory and disk. The repository's headline architecture is
CP-factorized, which makes the first claim true by construction and says nothing
about the second, and the two come apart here by a factor of 280 in one
direction and 1.6 in the other. So the numbers have to be measured rather than
inferred, and the measurement has to be hard to fool.

Three things make timing results wrong more often than not, and each is handled
explicitly rather than hoped away:

* **Warmup.** The first forward pass allocates workspaces, picks FFT plans and
  faults in pages. ``latency`` discards a warmup phase and reports a median over
  repeats, plus the interquartile range, because a mean over a lazily-initialised
  first call is a measurement of allocation.
* **Threads.** A model that parallelises well looks fast on a 10-core laptop and
  ordinary on a 4-vCPU notebook VM. Every timing here takes an explicit thread
  count and restores the previous setting, so a "faster model" is never just a
  better-parallelising one.
* **Batch.** Costs that do not scale with batch size -- and the CP weight
  reconstruction is exactly one -- are invisible in throughput benchmarks and
  dominant at batch 1. Both are reported.

The FLOP model is analytic and closed form
------------------------------------------
``analytic_flops`` derives the count from the architecture rather than tracing
it, for a reason that matters: ``torch.utils.flop_counter`` does not count FFTs,
and an FNO is mostly FFT. A traced count is therefore an undercount of exactly
the term that distinguishes these architectures. The analytic model is checked
against the tracer on the operations the tracer does cover (``flop_audit``), so
it is pinned where pinning is possible and explicit where it is not.

Conventions, stated because FLOP counts are not comparable without them:

* one multiply-accumulate is 2 flops;
* one complex multiply-accumulate is 8 real flops (4 real multiplies, 4 adds);
* a real 2-D FFT of an ``H x W`` field is ``2.5 * H * W * log2(H * W)`` flops,
  the usual halving of the ``5 N log2 N`` complex-FFT figure (Cooley-Tukey).
