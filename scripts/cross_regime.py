r"""Leave-one-regime-out generalization: how far does LiteFNO travel?

Board task: "Test LITEFNO generalization: train on subset of disaster types,
test on held-out type -- measure cross-disaster gap."

The Well's Gray-Scott dataset is stored as six named regimes, each a distinct
(F, k) parameter pair producing qualitatively different dynamics -- bubbles,
gliders, maze, spirals, spots, worms. They are this repo's "types": a model
trained on five of them and tested on the sixth has to extrapolate to a pattern
class it has never seen, which is the question the task asks.

Six folds. Each holds out one regime, trains on the other five, and evaluates
the same trained model twice: on the held-out regime's test trajectories, and on
the five seen regimes' test trajectories. The gap is the ratio between them.

Why the gap and not the absolute error
--------------------------------------
Both numbers come from one model, one training run, one epoch budget. Anything
that would shift the absolute error -- a shorter schedule, fewer trajectories,
different hardware -- shifts both, so the ratio survives choices the absolute
number does not. That matters here because each fold trains on 60 trajectories
against the reference run's 72, so its absolute error is not comparable to
ext13's; the ratio is comparable to itself across folds, which is what the
question needs.

The gap is also tracked at every evaluation checkpoint rather than read once at
the end, so a reader can see whether it is stable or still moving. A gap that
has plateaued by epoch 40 does not depend on the epoch budget; one still drifting
at the end would.

A prediction made before the runs
---------------------------------
ext10 measured, per regime, what fraction of spatial variance sits below mode 8:
spirals 77%, gliders 69%, bubbles 58%, worms 31%, maze 1.3%, spots 0.6%. Maze
and spots are outliers by two orders of magnitude -- their energy sits in a
narrow band at the Turing wavelength near mode 13-16 while the others are
low-wavenumber.

If what a model transfers is spectral content, then holding out a regime whose
spectrum is unlike the training set should hurt most, and maze and spots should
be the worst two folds. That is a prediction with a direction, checked against
the committed ext10 numbers rather than read off these results afterwards.

The alternative it is being tested against is that the gap is governed by
something else entirely -- difficulty, or how much the field moves per step --
in which case the ordering will not follow the spectrum.

Three arms: can the gap be closed? (ext26)
------------------------------------------
Measuring the gap invites the obvious follow-up -- can it be bought down? Two
standard answers are added as arms on top of the baseline, in the order that
keeps them separable:

  baseline    plain LiteFNO, MSE on clean inputs
  robust      identical, but inputs are perturbed during training at 30 dB
  robust+unc  identical to `robust`, evaluated as a 4-member deep ensemble

`robust+unc` differs from `robust` in exactly one field (member count), so the
difference between them is the ensemble's contribution with the augmentation
held fixed. Reporting one arm that changed both at once would confound them.

The noise scale is not tuned. 30 dB is taken from ext3's committed noise curve,
which used ``std * 10 ** (-snr / 20)`` on the input only; reusing the definition
means the augmentation strength can be read against an existing measurement of
what that perturbation costs at test time, rather than being chosen because it
made the result look good.

The headline is the fraction of the baseline gap each arm closes,
``(g_base - g_arm) / (g_base - 1)``, which is 1.0 when the held-out regime
becomes as cheap as the seen ones. That ratio has a failure mode worth naming:
it also improves when the *seen* regimes get worse, which is not
generalization. So the held-out and seen errors are carried next to it and any
fold whose gap closed without the held-out error falling is flagged rather than
counted.
